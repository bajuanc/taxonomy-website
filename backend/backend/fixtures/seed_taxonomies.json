The afforestation plan contains all elements required by the national law relating to environmental impact assessment of afforestation. 1.2 Preferably through the afforestation plan, or if information is missing, through any other document, detailed information is provided on the following points: description of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry; site preparation and its impacts on pre-existing carbon stocks, including soils and above-ground biomass, in order to protect land with high carbon stock(3)Land with high-carbon stock means wetlands, including peatland, and continuously forested areas within the meaning of Article 29(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.; management goals, including major constraints; general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle; definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution; compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions; measures deployed to establish and maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems; consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law); assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks; assessment of impact on food security; all DNSH criteria relevant to afforestation. 1.3.

The activity complies with the following criteria: the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity; the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to 100 years. 2.2. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria: the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(71)2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (version of [adoption date]: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/).. In particular, if the wetland definition used in that analysis differs from the wetland definition used in the national GHG inventory, the analysis includes an identification of the different land categories covered by the involved area. The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage. For coastal wetlands, climate benefit analysis considers projections of expected relative sea level rise and the potential that the wetlands will migrate; the business-as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following: the management practices as documented before the start of the activity, if any; the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity. the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used; emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with the criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances. 4. Guarantee of permanence 4.1. In accordance with national law, the wetland status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures: the area is designated to be retained as wetland and may not be converted to other land use; the area is classified as a protected area; the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a wetland. 4.2. In accordance with the national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the restoration plan, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the environmental protection and restoration activities defined in this Regulation. 5. Audit Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and with the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following: the relevant national competent authorities; an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity. In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit. The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity. 6. Group assessment The compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits.",

For operation of existing hydropower plants, including refurbishment activities to enhance renewable energy or energy storage potential, the activity complies with the following criteria: 2.1. In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. 2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. 2.3. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3. For construction of new hydropower plants, the activity complies with the following criteria: 3.1. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. 3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). 3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. 3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned hydropower plant may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.",

The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of the new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature-based solutions, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment to existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity, including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. That result is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause.

For operation of existing hydropower plants, including refurbishment activities to enhance renewable energy or energy storage potential, the activity complies with the following criteria: 2.1. In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. 2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. 2.3. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3. For construction of new hydropower plants, the activity complies with the following criteria: 3.1. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. 3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). 3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. 3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned hydropower plant may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.",

In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to refurbishment/construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to, where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature based solution, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment of existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity (including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow); measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.",

The insurance activity uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that: properly reflect climate change risks; do not only rely on historical trend; integrate forward-looking scenarios. 1.2. The insurer publicly discloses how the climate change risks are considered in the insurance activity. 1.3. With the exception of legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, the insurance activity provides incentives for risk reduction by setting out the (pre)-conditions for the insurance coverage of risk and by acting as a price signal of risk. For the purpose of this point, reduced premiums or deductibles, possibly based on supportive information on existing/possible actions, to policyholders who protect an asset or activity against natural catastrophes damages may be considered an incentive for risk reduction. 1.4. After a climate risk event, the insurer provides information on the conditions under which coverage under the insurance activity could be renewed or maintained and in particular the benefits of building better in that context. 2. Product design: 2.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders. For the purpose of this point, where a policyholder has invested in adaptation measures, lower premiums may be considered as a risk-based reward for preventive actions taken by policyholders. By way of derogation from this point, where legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums prevent the insurance or reinsurance company from providing risk-based rewards, insurance products may instead provide to customers measures in relation to an asset, an activity, or people that prevent or protect against natural catastrophes. Such measures may be provided as information or advice to customers on climate risks and preventive measures that customers could take. 2.2. The distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures that they could take, for the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, including any impact of such measures on the insurance coverage or the premium level. 3. Innovative insurance coverage solutions: 3.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer coverage for the climate-related perils(710)See Appendix A. where the demands and needs of policyholders require so. 3.2. Depending on the demands and needs of individual customers, products may include specific risk transfer solutions such as protection against business interruption, contingent business interruption, other non-physical damage-related loss factors, cascading effects and interdependencies of hazards (secondary perils), cascading impacts of interacting natural and technological hazards, critical infrastructure failures. 4.

Those public authorities declare to use the data for purposes of enhancing adaptation to climate change by the society in a region, country or internationally and the insurer provides the data at a level of granularity sufficient for the use declared by the respective public authorities. 4.2.

    "substantial_contribution_criteria": "1. Leadership in modelling and pricing of climate risks: 1.1. The reinsurance activity uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that: are used to properly reflect in the premium level the exposure, hazard and vulnerability to climate change risks as well as actions taken by the policyholder of the insurer to protect the insured asset or activity against those risks, where such information is provided by the insurer to the reinsurer; do not only rely on historical trends; integrate forward-looking scenarios. 1.2. The reinsurer discloses publicly how the risks stemming from climate-related perils are considered in the reinsurance activity. 2. Supporting development and supply of enabling non-life reinsurance products: 2.1. The reinsurance activity’s underlying products cover risks stemming from climate-related perils and reward, in a risk-based manner and without prejudice to legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders. 2.2. The reinsurance activity complies with one or more of the following criteria: where desired by the insurer, the reinsurer engages with the insurer, either directly or via a reinsurance intermediary, during the development of the underlying product by: discussing possible reinsurance solutions that the reinsurer is willing to offer in relation to that product. The final product is brought to market using one of the reinsurance solutions that were discussed with the reinsurer during the product development phase; providing data or other technical advice enabling the insurer to price the coverage for risks stemming from climate-related perils as well as risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders; the insurer would likely reduce or discontinue its coverage under the underlying product without the reinsurance agreement or a comparable reinsurance agreement in place; the reinsurer provides, as part of the business relationship with the insurer or the reinsurance intermediary, data or other technical advice or both enabling the insurer to offer coverage of risks stemming from climate-related perils and the coverage allows for risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders. 2.3. Where a reinsurance product applies at the level of a portfolio of underlying products, only a share of the reinsurance activity’s underlying products may cover risks stemming from climate- related perils and reward, in a risk-based manner, preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders for the purpose of point 2.1. In that case, the reinsurer is able to identify the share of reinsurance premiums that relate to those underlying products. 3. Innovative reinsurance coverage solutions: 3.1. Reinsurance products sold under the reinsurance activity offer coverage for risks stemming from climate-related perils where the demands and needs of the insurer’s clients, based on the underlying products, require so. Such insurance products appropriately reflect risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders. 3.2. Depending on the demands and needs of the individual customers of the insurer, reinsurance products may include specific risk transfer solutions which may include protection against business interruption, contingent business interruption, other non-physical damage-related loss factors, cascading effects and interdependencies of hazards (secondary perils), cascading impacts of interacting natural and technological hazards or critical infrastructure failures. 4. Data sharing: 4.1. With due regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, a significant share of loss data related to the reinsurer’s activity is made available, free of charge, to one or several public authorities for the purpose of analytical research. The public authorities declare to use the data for purposes of enhancing adaptation to climate change by the society in a region, country or internationally and the reinsurer provides the data at a level of granularity sufficient for the use declared by the respective public authorities. 4.2. Where the reinsurer is not yet sharing such data with a public authority for the aforementioned purpose, it has declared the intention to make its data available, free of charge, to interested third parties and has indicated under which conditions such data can be shared. That declaration of intention to share available data is easily accessible, including on the reinsurer’s website, for relevant public authorities. 5. High level of service in post-disaster situation: Claims under the reinsurance activity, both ongoing and those from large-scale loss events resulting from risks stemming from climate-related perils, are processed fairly with respect to customers, in accordance with high handling standards for claims and in timely fashion in line with applicable law and there has been no failure to do so in the context of recent large-scale loss events. Where appropriate, the reinsurer supports the insurer or the reinsurance intermediary in assessing the claims from the underlying product. Information as regards procedures on additional measures by the reinsurer in case of large-scale loss events is publicly available.",

On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature-based solutions, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment to existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity, including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.",

The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are carried out in accordance with EN 15978 (BS EN 15978:2011). The scope of building elements and technical equipment is as defined in the Level(s) common EU framework for indicator 1.2. Following the Level(s) indicator 1.2 reporting format, the indicator is communicated as GWP fossil, GWP biogenic, GWP land use and land use change, as well as the sum of these (GWP overall). Where a national calculation tool exists or is required for making disclosures or for obtaining building permits, the respective tool may be used to provide the required disclosure.

The use of primary raw material in the construction of the building is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials(81)For the purposes of the Delegated Act, ’secondary raw materials’ means materials that have been prepared for re-use or recycled in accordance with Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive and have ceased to be waste under Article 6 of that Directive.. The operator of the activity ensures that the three heaviest material categories used to construct the building, measured by mass in kilogrammes, comply with the following maximum total amounts of primary raw material used: for the combined total of concrete(82)This concerns the material concrete, including its constituent ingredients (for example, aggregates). Any steel reinforcement is excluded since this is a different material which can be accounted for under metals., natural or agglomerated stone, a maximum of 70% of the material come from primary raw material; for the combined total of brick, tile, ceramic, a maximum of 70% of the material come from primary raw material; for bio-based materials(83)Bio-based materials are made using biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), as defined in COM(2018) 673. They include conventional bio-based materials made traditionally from biomass (such as wood, cork, natural rubber, paper, textiles, wooden construction materials) and more recently developed materials such as bio-based chemicals or bio-based plastics., a maximum of 80% of the total material come from primary raw material; for the combined total of glass, mineral insulation, a maximum of 70% of the total material come from primary raw material; for non-biobased plastic, a maximum of 50% of the total material come from primary raw material; for metals, a maximum of 30% of the total material come from primary raw material; for gypsum, a maximum of 65% of the material come from primary raw material. The thresholds are calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of each material category used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of a construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100% primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material. Compliance with this criterion is demonstrated by reporting in accordance with the Level(s) indicator 2.1(84)See Level(s) indicator 2.1: Bill of Quantities, materials and lifespans, User manual: introductory briefing, instructions and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau//sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_2.1_v1.1_34pp.pdf.

This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Commission Decision 2000/532/EC. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 70% threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2(101)See Level(s) indicator 2.2: Construction and demolition waste and materials, User Manual: introductory briefing, instructions and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau//sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_2.2_v1.1_40pp.pdf.

The life cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP)(102)The GWP is communicated as a numeric indicator for each life cycle stage expressed as kgCO2e/m2 (of useful internal floor area) averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years. The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are carried out in accordance with EN 15978 (BS EN 15978:2011. Sustainability of construction works. Assessment of environmental performance of buildings. Calculation method). The scope of building elements and technical equipment is as defined in the Level(s) common EU framework for indicator 1.2. Where a national calculation tool exists, or is required for making disclosures or for obtaining building permits, the respective tool may be used to provide the required disclosure. Other calculation tools may be used if they fulfil the minimum criteria laid down by the Level(s) common EU framework, see Level(s) indicator 1.2: Lifecycle Global Warming Potential (GWP), User manual: introductory briefing, instructions and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_1.2_v1.1_37pp.pdf. of the building’s renovation works has been calculated for each stage in the life cycle, from the point of renovation, and is disclosed to investors and clients on demand. 3. Construction designs and techniques support circularity via the incorporation of concepts for design for adaptability and deconstruction as outlined in Level(s) indicators 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with this requirement by reporting on the Level(s) indicators 2.3(103)See Level(s) indicator 2.3: Design for adaptability and renovation, User manual: introductory briefing, instruction and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau//sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_2.3_v1.1_23pp.pdf. and 2.4(104)See Level(s) indicator 2.4: Design for deconstruction user manual: introductory briefing, instructions and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_2.4_v1.1_18pp.pdf. at Level 2. 4. At least 50% of the original building is retained. This is to be calculated based on the gross external floor area retained from the original building using the applicable national or regional measurement methodology, alternatively using the definition of ‘IPMS 1’ contained in the International Property Measurement Standards(105)International Property Measurement Standards: All Buildings. Published by the International Property Measurement Standards Coalition (IPMSC), https://ipmsc.org/.. 5. The use of primary raw material in the renovation of the building is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials(106)For the purposes of the Delegated Act, ’secondary raw materials’ means materials that have been prepared for re-use or recycled in accordance with Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive and have ceased to be waste under Article 6 of that Directive.. The operator of the activity ensures that the three heaviest material categories that have been newly added to the building in the renovation of the building, measured by mass in kilogrammes, comply with the following thresholds regarding the maximum amount of primary raw material used: for the combined total of concrete(107)This concerns the material concrete, including its constituent ingredients (for example, aggregates). Any steel reinforcement is excluded since this is a different material which can be accounted for under metals., natural or agglomerated stone, a maximum of 85% of the material come from primary raw material; for the combined total of brick, tile, ceramic, a maximum of 85% of the material come from primary raw material; for bio-based materials(108)Bio-based materials are made using biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), as defined in COM(2018) 673. They include conventional bio-based materials made traditionally from biomass (such as wood, cork, natural rubber, paper, textiles, wooden construction materials) and more recently developed materials such as bio-based chemicals or bio-based plastics., a maximum of 90% of the material come from primary raw material; for the combined total of glass, mineral insulation, a maximum of 85% of the material come from primary raw material; for non-biobased plastic, a maximum of 75% of the material come from primary raw material; for metals, a maximum of 65% of the material come from primary raw material; for gypsum, a maximum of 83% of the material come from primary raw material. The thresholds are calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of each material category used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of the construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100% primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material. Compliance with this criterion is demonstrated by reporting in accordance with the Level(s) indicator 2.1(109)See Level(s) indicator 2.1: Bill of Quantities, materials and lifespans, User manual: introductory briefing, instructions and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau//sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_2.1_v1.1_34pp.pdf.

The operator of the activity uses electronic tools to describe the characteristics of the building as built, including the materials and components used, for the purpose of future maintenance, recovery, and reuse, for example using EN ISO22057:2022 to provide Environmental Product Declarations(110)ISO standard 22057:2022, Sustainability in buildings and civil engineering works — Data templates for the use of environmental product declarations (EPDs) for construction products in building information modelling (BIM) (version of April 2022), https://www.iso.org/standard/72463.html.. The information is stored in a digital format and is made available to investors and clients on demand. In addition, the operator of the activity ensures the long-term preservation of this information beyond the useful life of the building by using the information managing systems provided by national tools, such as cadastre or public register.",

The operator of the activity uses electronic tools to describe the characteristics of the building as built, including the materials and components used, for the purpose of future maintenance, recovery, and reuse, for example using EN ISO 22057:2022 to provide Environmental Product Declarations(139)ISO standard 22057:2022, Sustainability in buildings and civil engineering works — Data templates for the use of environmental product declarations (EPDs) for construction products in building information modelling (BIM) (version of April 2022), https://www.iso.org/standard/72463.html.. The information is stored in a digital format and is made available to investors and clients on demand. In addition, the operator ensures the long-term preservation of this information beyond the useful life of the building by using the information managing systems provided by national tools, such as cadastre or public register. 6. Bridges, tunnels, dikes and sluices are inspected regularly by a nationally approved inspector and the data is used to predict maintenance needs.",

According to the type of activity, the activity complies with the requirements set out either in the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treatment(48)Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1147. or the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste incineration(49)Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2010 of 12 November 2019 establishing the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, for waste incineration (OJ L 312, 3.12.2019, p. 55).. Facilities that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 2010/75/EU are not considered as compliant with the Technical Screening Criteria. 1.2. During the pre-acceptance procedures, at least the following information is gathered: expected date of arrival at the waste treatment plant; contact details of the waste producer, the sector which the waste originates from and the nature of process producing the waste, including the variability of the process; the estimated quantity expected to be delivered to the operator per delivery and per year; description of the waste, including composition, hazardous properties of the waste, waste code and the suitable treatment route. 1.3. During the acceptance procedures, the following elements are in place: a reception facility equipped with a laboratory to analyse samples on site and documented analytical standard operating procedures, with the option to sub-contract analyses to accredited external contract laboratories; documented sampling procedure consistent with relevant standards, such as EN 14899:2005(50)EN 14899:2005 Characterization of waste - Sampling of waste materials - Framework for the preparation and application of a Sampling Plan.; documented analysis of the relevant physico-chemical parameters for the treatment; a dedicated quarantine waste storage area, as well as written procedures to manage non-accepted waste. The personnel dealing with the pre-acceptance and acceptance procedures is able, due to their profession or experience, to deal with all necessary questions relevant for the treatment of the wastes in the waste treatment facility. The procedures are intended to pre-accepting and accepting wastes at the waste treatment plant only if a suitable treatment route is available and the disposal or recovery route for the output of the treatment is determined. For ‘blending or mixing activities’ (as set out in Annex I, section 5.1(c) of Directive 2010/75/EU), the operator is not using dilution to lower the concentration of one or more hazardous substances present in the waste, with the aim for the resulting waste mix to be declassified and become ‘non-hazardous waste’ and thus be subsequently treated in facilities non-dedicated to the treatment of hazardous waste. Dilution is not used as a ‘substitute’ to the adequate treatment of the waste. 2. For the physico-chemical treatment of solid or pasty waste, any treatment for the purpose of treating waste prior to final disposal, such as in hazardous waste landfills, is designed to fullfil the following requirements: limit at 6% the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) maximum concentration in each single input waste to the landfill; limit at 1 000 mg/kg dry matter Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) content of the output waste after a leaching test with L/S = 10 l/kg based on EU Standard EN 12457-2:2002(51)EN 12457-2:2002 Characterisation of waste - Leaching - Compliance test for leaching of granular waste materials and sludges - Part 2: One stage batch test at a liquid to solid ratio of 10 l/kg for materials with particle size below 4 mm (without or with size reduction).. 3. For the physico-chemical treatment of waste with calorific value, measures are taken in order to avoid dilution and dispersion of hazardous substances, and to avoid any high loads released into the air due to inappropriate final treatment of waste with calorific value. Any treatment installation prior to final thermal treatments (incineration or co-incineration) is to be designed with the purpose of limiting the content of hazardous substances (and meet other related criteria) for each single input waste treated at the physico-chemical treatment installation, so that the acceptance levels at the entrance of the final thermal treatment installations are respected. 4. For the treatment of aqueous liquid waste, the biological treatability of the waste water resulting from the treatment of the water-based liquid waste in a biological waste water treatment plant is judged based on the following criterion: Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC elimination of >70% in 7 days (>80% when adapted inoculum is used) in accordance with EN ISO 9888(52)EN ISO 9888:1999 Water quality — Evaluation of ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds in aqueous medium — Static test (Zahn-Wellens method), version of [adoption date] available at: https://www.iso.org/standard/28121.html. (Zahn Wellens), or other commonly accepted, equivalent industry standards and methodologies used to assess bio-elimination and related performances. 5. For the treatment of waste containing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), all waste containing POP substances listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 are controlled and traced as hazardous waste in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2008/98/EC. Specific requirements of Articles 7(4), 17, 18 and 19 of Directive 2008/98/EC apply. In case of transboundary movement, requirements of Chapter I of the Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council(53)Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste (OJ L 190, 12.7.2006, p. 1). apply. The tracking system in place in the installations based on the best practices referred to above allows the monitoring of: the effective separation of each part of a product or waste such as waste equipment, containing or contaminated with POP above the levels defined in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021; the effective destruction or irreversible transformation of the POP waste in compliance with Articles 7(2) – 7(4) and Annex V to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021. 6. For the treatment of mercury-containing waste(54)Mercury-containing waste means waste consisting of, containing or contaminated with mercury or mercury compounds., all installations likely to treat waste consisting of, containing or contaminated with mercury or mercury compounds (as defined in Article 11 of the Minamata Convention), implementthe traceability system set out in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/852 or a similar traceability system. Based on this tracking system, the installations treating mercury-containing waste monitor the effective safe fate of mercury and mercury compounds in appropriate final destination. 7. For the (non-combustion) treatment of healthcare waste, the installation implements the best practices set out in the WHO handbook on safe management of wastes from health-care activities(55)WHO, Safe management of wastes from health-care activities, 2nd edition, 2014, version of [adoption date] available at https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/268779/Safe-management-of-wastes-from-health-care-activities-Eng.pdf.. A non-combustion healthcare waste installation has specific acceptance procedure, monitors and can prove that the following types of healthcare waste are not accepted for treatment: cytotoxic waste; pharmaceutical waste; chemical waste; radioactive waste. The technologies used are certified by an independent certification body.",

Al asegurar que los programas de educación y capacitación sean accesibles para todos, incluidas las mujeres, los jóvenes y los grupos marginados, se promueve la igualdad de oportunidades en la gestión de recursos hídricos.\nEsto contribuye a cerrar las brechas de género y a garantizar que las voces de todos los sectores de la comunidad sean escuchadas y consideradas en la toma de decisiones.\n● Desarrollo de Liderazgo Local. Identificar y capacitar líderes comunitarios en aspectos de conservación y gestión del agua potencia el desarrollo de liderazgo local. Estos líderes pueden inspirar y movilizar a la comunidad hacia prácticas sostenibles, asegurando la sostenibilidad a largo plazo de las iniciativas de agua.\nCONSTRUCCIÓN DE CONOCIMIENTOS LOCALES\nLas comunidades pesqueras y aquellas que practican agricultura enfocada en el ahorro de agua poseen conocimientos tradicionales esenciales para la gestión sostenible de recursos acuáticos. La integración de estos saberes con enfoques científicos modernos facilita estrategias de adaptación efectivas. Reconocer y valorar prácticas como la pesca sostenible y la irrigación eficiente contribuye no solo a la conservación ecológica, sino también al bienestar de las comunidades dependientes de estos recursos, promoviendo un manejo armónico que combina tradición y ciencia para la resiliencia ambiental y social.",
